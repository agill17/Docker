# Docker
All docker stuff

The docker-compose.yml is responsible for building and starting all containers from tomcat+jenkins+artifactory
Yes, they are all running on the same bridge network on host.

The images are build on fly from docker hub and not build if they exist in your local image cache.

Wonder how many container I can keep on extending :O
