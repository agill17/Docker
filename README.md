# Docker
All docker stuff

The docker-compose.yml is responsible for building and starting all containers from tomcat+jenkins+artifactory
Yes, they are all running on the same bridge network on host.

The images are pulled from docker hub and not pulled if they exist in your local image cache.

Wonder how many container I can keep on extending :O
